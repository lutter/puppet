# == Synopsis 
#
# Retrieve the client configuration from the central puppet server and apply
# it to the local host.
#
# Currently must be run out periodically, using cron or something similar.
#
# = Usage
#
#   puppetd  [-D|--daemonize|--no-daemonize] [-d|--debug] [--disable] [--enable]
#       [-h|--help] [--fqdn <host name>] [-l|--logdest syslog|<file>|console]
#       [-o|--onetime] [--serve <handler>] [-t|--test] [--noop]
#       [-V|--version] [-v|--verbose] [-w|--waitforcert <seconds>]
#
# = Description
#
# This is the main puppet client.  Its job is to retrieve the local machine's
# configuration from a remote server and apply it.  In order to successfully
# communicate with the remote server, the client must have a certificate signed
# by a certificate authority that the server trusts; the recommended method
# for this, at the moment, is to run a certificate authority as part of the
# puppet server (which is the default).  The client will connect and request
# a signed certificate, and will continue connecting until it receives one.
#
# Once the client has a signed certificate, it will retrieve its configuration
# and apply it.
#
# = Usage Notes
#
# +puppetd+ does its best to find a compromise between interactive use and
# daemon use.  Run with no arguments and no configuration, it will go into the
# backgroun, attempt to get a signed certificate, and retrieve and apply its
# configuration every 30 minutes.
#
# Some flags are meant specifically for interactive use -- in particular,
# +test+ and +tags+ are useful.  +test+ enables verbose logging, causes
# the daemon to stay in the foreground, exits if the server's configuration is
# invalid (this happens if, for instance, you've left a syntax error on the
# server), and exits after running the configuration once (rather than hanging
# around as a long-running process).
#
# +tags+ allows you to specify what portions of a configuration you want to apply.
# Puppet elements are tagged with all of the class or definition names that
# contain them, and you can use the +tags+ flag to specify one of these names,
# causing only configuration elements contained within that class or definition
# to be applied.  This is very useful when you are testing new configurations --
# for instance, if you are just starting to manage +ntpd+, you would put all of
# the new elements into an +ntpd+ class, and call puppet with +--tags ntpd+,
# which would only apply that small portion of the configuration during your
# testing, rather than applying the whole thing.
#
# = Options
#
# Note that any configuration parameter that's valid in the configuration file
# is also a valid long argument.  For example, 'server' is a valid configuration
# parameter, so you can specify '--server <servername>' as an argument.
#
# See the configuration file documentation at
# http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/ConfigurationReference for
# the full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
# configuration options can also be generated by running puppetd with
# '--genconfig'.
#
# daemonize::
#   Send the process into the background.  This is the default.
#
# no-daemonize::
#   Do not send the process into the background.
#
# debug::
#   Enable full debugging.
#
# disable::
#   Disable working on the local system.  This puts a lock file in place,
#   causing +puppetd+ not to work on the system until the lock file is removed.
#   This is useful if you are testing a configuration and do not want the central
#   configuration to override the local state until everything is tested and
#   committed.
#
#   +puppetd+ uses the same lock file while it is running, so no more than one
#   +puppetd+ process is working at a time.
#
#   +puppetd+ exits after executing this.
#
# enable::
#   Enable working on the local system.  This removes any lock file, causing
#   +puppetd+ to start managing the local system again (although it will continue
#   to use its normal scheduling, so it might not start for another half hour).
#
#   +puppetd+ exits after executing this.
#
# fqdn::
#   Set the fully-qualified domain name of the client.  This is only used for
#   certificate purposes, but can be used to override the discovered hostname.
#   If you need to use this flag, it is generally an indication of a setup problem.
#
# help::
#   Print this help message
#
# logdest::
#   Where to send messages.  Choose between syslog, the console, and a log file.
#   Defaults to sending messages to syslog, or the console if debugging or
#   verbosity is enabled.
#
# no-client::
#   Do not create a config client.  This will cause the daemon to run
#   without ever checking for its configuration automatically, and only
#   makes sense when used in conjunction with --listen.
#
# onetime::
#   Run the configuration once, rather than as a long-running daemon.  This is
#   useful for interactively running puppetd.
#
# serve::
#   Start another type of server.  By default, +puppetd+ will start
#   a service handler that allows authenticated and authorized remote nodes to
#   trigger the configuration to be pulled down and applied.  You can specify
#   any handler here that does not require configuration, e.g., filebucket, ca,
#   or resource.  The handlers are in +lib/puppet/network/handler+, and the names
#   must match exactly, both in the call to +serve+ and in +namespaceauth.conf+.
#
# test::
#   Enable the most common options used for testing.  These are +onetime+,
#   +verbose+, +ignorecache, and +no-usecacheonfailure+.
#
# noop::
#   Use +noop+ mode where the daemon runs in a no-op or dry-run mode.  This is useful
#   for seeing what changes Puppet will make without actually executing the changes.
#
# verbose::
#   Turn on verbose reporting.
#
# version::
#   Print the puppet version number and exit.
#
# waitforcert::
#   This option only matters for daemons that do not yet have certificates
#   and it is enabled by default, with a value of 120 (seconds).  This causes
#   +puppetd+ to connect to the server every 2 minutes and ask it to sign a
#   certificate request.  This is useful for the initial setup of a puppet
#   client.  You can turn off waiting for certificates by specifying a time
#   of 0.
